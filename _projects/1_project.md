I won HackPSU Spring 2024 with a team of five members. We developed a platform for any community to seek out and lend help to anyone in the world. We designed and developed the platform using React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative. We were applauded for the best design using React.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
